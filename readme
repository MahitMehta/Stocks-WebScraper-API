To use this web application, aside from having flask and selenium installed,
you will mandatorily be required to download the latest chromedriver.

1. To do this you first need to head over to "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads".

2. Next, you will need to click on the latest driver version, from there you will be redirected.

3. Now you will have to select the correct download link for your system's software.

4. This will install a zip file from which you will need to extract the folder inside. 

5. Lastly, take out the file called chromedriver.exe from the extracted folder and move that file
into the root directory of your project.
